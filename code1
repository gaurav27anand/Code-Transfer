Subject: Mandatory Onboarding of Projects to the Deco-Tool for Release Management
Dear Project Owners,

As part of the Zerocopy monorepo, every project undergoes periodic releases, some more frequently than others. Over time, older releases accumulate in our AFS storage, consuming significant space. Currently, when the assigned storage limit is exceeded (~600 releases), the system automatically blocks further releases, disrupting the automated deployment pipeline.

To address this, we are integrating all projects into our Auto-Deco Tool, a release management solution designed to optimize storage by safely decommissioning outdated releases while ensuring critical dependencies remain intact.

Action Required from You:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review Default Settings ‚Äì We have pre-defined settings for release decommissioning, which I will share for your review. Please confirm whether these settings work for your project or if modifications are needed.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Provide Your Input ‚Äì If your project has any specific retention policies or requirements, please communicate them.

How the Deco-Tool Works:
‚úÖ Thorough Analysis Before Decommissioning:

Checks if a release is actively used or has any dependencies.
Monitors access logs (last usage, whether accessed by a human or an automated system).
Ensures critical releases are not mistakenly removed.
‚úÖ Failsafe Recovery Mechanism:

In rare cases where a necessary release is removed, we have a recovery process in place to restore it.
Next Steps:
üìÖ Deadline: Please review the provided settings and submit any feedback by the end of this week.
üìÖ Onboarding Schedule: I will begin onboarding all projects into the deco-tool next week.

This onboarding is mandatory for all projects under Zerocopy. Failure to do so may result in storage limitations affecting future releases.

If you have any concerns or need further clarification, feel free to reach out.

Best,
